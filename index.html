                <p class="intro-text">
                    Across two decades of organizational life—in boardrooms, training centers, and quiet one-on-one
                    conversations—Melissa has worked with leaders at every level who carry the same question: <em>How do
                        I trust myself as much as others trust me?</em>
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    She's built learning & development strategies inside real companies. She's coached senior leaders
                    through moments of high visibility and internal doubt. She's designed training programs that
                    translate complexity into clarity and confidence into embodied skill.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    Melissa doesn't teach confidence as a personality trait or a performance. She teaches it as
                    something learned, practiced, and returned to—especially when the stakes are high.
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    Her work is grounded in psychology, shaped by experience, and built for people who no longer need to
                    prove they're capable—but who want to feel as steady inside as they appear outside.

                    This work is for leaders who no longer need to prove they're capable—but who want to stop editing

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We begin with clarity: a conversation about where you are, where you want to be, and what's
                            in the way. From there, we design a structure that fits your schedule and needs—typically
                            60-minute sessions, bi-weekly or monthly. This isn't therapy. It's practical,
                            psychology-informed work on presence, self-trust, and leadership embodiment.</p>

                            transition support) or longer (ongoing executive coaching). Sessions are scheduled around
                            your calendar. The work happens both in sessions and in the moments you apply what we
                            discuss.</p>

                            up. The work is internal, structural, and sustainable—not motivational momentum that fades

                            development programs, keynotes), I work both virtually and in-person depending on your
